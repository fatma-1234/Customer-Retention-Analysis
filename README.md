**Customer Retention & Churn Analysis**
A complete end-to-end Data Analytics Project using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and Power BI, focused on analyzing customer churn, identifying churn-risk segments, and building a business-ready dashboard.

**Project Overview**
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses.
This project explores what drives customers to leave, and provides insights that help reduce churn.
This project includes:

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)
Feature Engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Churn segmentation
Power BI Dashboard for business insights
Actionable recommendations**
This showcases my ability to work end-to-end on a real-world data analytics project.

**🐍 Python Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)**
Key Steps Performed:

✔ Loaded and cleaned customer dataset
✔ Checked datatypes, missing values, duplicates
✔ Created new useful features:

CustomerAgeGroup

HighCharges (above/below average bill)

✔ Performed exploratory data analysis:

Churn % by age group
