**📊 Customer Retention & Churn Analysis**

A complete end-to-end Data Analytics Project using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and Power BI, focused on understanding customer churn, identifying churn-risk segments, and building a business-ready dashboard.

**🚀 Project Overview**

Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses.
This project identifies:

Why customers leave
Which groups are at highest risk
What business strategies can reduce churn

This project highlights my end-to-end skills in:
✔ Data cleaning
✔ Feature engineering
✔ Exploratory data analysis
✔ Visualization
✔ Dashboard building
✔ Insight storytelling

**🐍 Python Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)**
Key Steps Performed

✔ Loaded and cleaned customer dataset
✔ Checked datatypes, missing values, duplicates
✔ Created new useful features:

CustomerAgeGroup

HighCharges (above/below average bill)

✔ Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Churn % by age group

Churn % by high charges

Churn distribution

Summary statistics

✔ Exported cleaned dataset for Power BI

📌 Notebook:
👉 01_data_explore.ipynb

📊 Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

📌 KPI Cards

Total Customers

Churned Customers

Overall Churn Rate

📌 Visualizations

Churn Composition (Pie Chart)

Churn Rate by High Charges

Churn Rate by Age Group

📌 Insights

Customers with high monthly charges churn more

Middle-aged customers show highest churn risk

Overall churn ≈ 40% → Needs strong retention strategy
